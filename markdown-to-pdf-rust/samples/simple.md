# Simple Document

This is a simple Markdown document to test the basic functionality of our Markdown to PDF converter.

## Introduction

The tool converts Markdown to PDF with LaTeX-like typography. It supports:

- Headers (H1 through H6)
- Paragraphs with proper spacing
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*  
- `Inline code`

### Code Blocks

Here's an example of a code block:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Lists

Here's a bulleted list:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

And a numbered list:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Conclusion

This simple test document demonstrates the basic features of the Markdown to PDF tool. The typography should be clean and professional, similar to LaTeX output.
