# Markdown to PDF Converter

A demonstration of the Rust-based Markdown to PDF conversion tool.

## Features Showcase

This document demonstrates various Markdown features supported by our converter:

### Typography Hierarchy

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2  
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

Each heading level uses appropriate font sizing and spacing for professional document layout.

### Text Formatting

This paragraph contains **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code` to demonstrate basic text formatting capabilities.

Here's another paragraph with mixed formatting: **bold**, *italic*, and even `code snippets` within the same line.

### Code Blocks

Here's a Rust code example:

```rust
use pulldown_cmark::Parser;
use printpdf::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let markdown = "# Hello, World!";
    let parser = Parser::new(markdown);
    
    // Process events and generate PDF
    Ok(())
}
```

And here's a bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Build and run the tool
cargo build --release
./target/release/markdown-to-pdf-rust input.md -o output.pdf

echo "PDF generated successfully!"
```

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item A
  - Nested item B
    - Deeply nested item
- Third item
- Fourth item with a very long line that should wrap properly when the text exceeds the available line width

#### Ordered Lists

1. Step one: Initialize the project
2. Step two: Configure dependencies
3. Step three: Implement core functionality
4. Step four: Add error handling
5. Step five: Test thoroughly

### Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph followed by a code block, then another paragraph to test spacing:

```
Simple code block without syntax highlighting
Multiple lines of code
With proper monospace formatting
```

The spacing between different elements should be consistent and professional, similar to LaTeX documents.

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases that the converter handles:

- Empty lines between elements
- Multiple consecutive spaces    (should normalize)
- Lines that are very long and need to wrap properly to fit within the page margins without breaking the overall document layout

## Performance Notes

The converter processes documents efficiently by:

1. **Parsing**: Using `pulldown-cmark` for fast Markdown parsing
2. **Rendering**: Direct PDF generation with `printpdf`
3. **Memory**: Minimal memory usage for large documents
4. **Speed**: Fast processing even for complex documents

### Technical Specifications

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Parser | pulldown-cmark 0.12 |
| PDF Library | printpdf 0.7 |
| Font System | Built-in PDF fonts |
| Page Format | A4 (210Ã—297mm) |
| Margins | 25mm all sides |

## Conclusion
