### [tagflow-vs-jinja-benchmark](./tagflow-vs-jinja-benchmark/)

Performance benchmark comparing [tagflow](https://github.com/lessrest/tagflow) and [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) for HTML generation. Tests various scenarios including simple pages, complex nested structures, and data tables. Results show Jinja2 with proper Environment setup is significantly faster across all scenarios.
