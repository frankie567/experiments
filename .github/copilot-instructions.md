# Experiments projects

This repository contains various experiments, prototypes and ideas I want to explore in Python.

Your role as an AI agent is to help me explore those ideas and implement them in Python.

You have an environment setup with Python 3.12 and `uv` package manager installed. You can read more about using `uv` here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

When I ask you to implement a new experiment, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder with a descriptive name for the experiment.
2. Inside that folder, create a `README.md` file explaining the purpose of the experiment
3. Create a `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies.
4. Implement the experiment in one or more Python files as needed.
5. Make sure the script can be run using `uv run <script_name>.py` command.

If the experiment produces output, like benchmark results or visualizations, please commit them to the repository as well.

After each new experiment, please add it to the main `README.md` file with a brief description and a link to the experiment folder.
